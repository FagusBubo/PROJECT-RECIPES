        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step<br>
                <p>
                    Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over low heat and cook onion, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent about 10 minutes. Add ginger, garlic, coriander, cumin, 
                    and turmeric and cook, stirring continuously, for 2 minutes. Stir in lentils and pour in vegetable stock. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently 
                    for 10 minutes.

            <li>Step<br>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook cauliflower until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.

                    Stir cauliflower, coconut milk, and carrot into the lentil mixture. Bring the curry back to a gentle simmer and cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. 
                    Stir in green beans and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes.
